### Utilities

This `Turborepo` has some additional tools already set for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type-safety
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Jest](https://prettier.io) & [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for testing

### Commands

This `Turborepo` already configured useful commands for all your apps and packages.

#### Build

```bash
# Will build all the app & packages with the supported `build` script.
npm run build

# ℹ️ If you plan to only build apps individually,
# Please make sure you've built the packages first.
```

#### Develop

```bash
# Will run the development server for all the app & packages with the supported `dev` script.
npm run dev
```

#### test

```bash
# Will launch a test suites for all the app & packages with the supported `test` script.
npm run test

# You can launch e2e testes with `test:e2e`
npm run test:e2e

# See `@repo/jest-config` to customize the behavior.
```

#### Lint

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```bash
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```bash
npx turbo link
```

## WebSocket configuration

The Web app (Next.js) streams logs over Socket.IO to the API (NestJS). To avoid connection instability and ease local setup, configure these environment variables:

- Web (.env in `apps/web`)
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` — Base URL of the API (defaults to `http://localhost:3001`). Used by socket clients to connect to `${BASE}/log`.

- API (.env in `apps/api`)
  - `WS_CORS_ORIGIN` — Allowed origins for Socket.IO CORS.
    - Set to `true` (or `1`, `yes`, `on`, `*`) to allow all (recommended for local dev).
    - Or provide a comma‑separated list: `http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
  - `WS_PING_TIMEOUT_MS` — Optional Socket.IO `pingTimeout` (ms).
  - `WS_PING_INTERVAL_MS` — Optional Socket.IO `pingInterval` (ms).

Examples:

```
# apps/web/.env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# apps/api/.env
WS_CORS_ORIGIN=true
# WS_PING_TIMEOUT_MS=30000
# WS_PING_INTERVAL_MS=25000
```

Notes:
- In development, React Strict Mode may cause double mounting of effects which can print duplicate connect/disconnect logs. This does not occur in production builds.
- The web socket client is configured to prefer `websocket` transport to reduce unnecessary polling/upgrade cycles.
